# Deep-Learning-for-Satellite-Imagery

This repository holds some personal projects in applying deep learning to satellite imagery(Remote Sensing). My interest is in Land Cover/Land use applications and object detecion.

## Land Cover





## Land Use Classification
1. Austin Zoning Satellite Images - How to classify the zoning of satellite pictures of the city of Austin?

![Zoning Code Sample](https://github.com/shakasom/Deep-Learning-for-Satellite-Imagery/blob/master/zoning.png)

The Austin Zoning Satellite Images dataset is hosted in Kaggle. It is small dataset(3667 satellite images) with a well defined and fine grained classification labels. Training the dataset with a simple convolution Neural Network (CNN) results in almost 0.90 accuracy. 

Notebook and Data availabe as Kaggle Kernel here: https://www.kaggle.com/shakasom/austin-zoning-classification-cnn-keras .
